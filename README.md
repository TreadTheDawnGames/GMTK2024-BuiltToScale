Babel or Bacon!
Rufus Pyro has burned down the town, and now the folk are after him! He needs to get as far away from them as possible. The problem is, he can only go up! 

Build a deck of cards and scale your tower to go as high as you can before it falls over.



This project was created in four days for GMTK Game Jam 2024.
